UI:
1. Authorization Login/Signout intro page (i18next with 5 languages).
2. ChatPage with sidebar + main chat window + Logout 
3. Messages flow correctly.
4. MongoDB integration: Users + Messages stored.
5. Group creation modal wired to backend.

The ChatSideBar is Basic but You can ofcourse have a look at it: <img width="360" height="821" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 1 58 32 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1d7225-27e5-4908-a7f4-34337b4aebe8" />

What I am gonna add more is :
- Image / file uploads with preview.
- Voice messages (record + send).
- AI-powered translations.
- Toxicity filter (block hate speech before sending).
- Chatbot integration (Q&A bot inside groups).

Although I do require a lot more time for integrating all of this, so see you on the other side when these lines of updating my projects won't exist anymore! Bye
